A Single Screen Android App allowing a User to Order a Coffee. The app allows a user to Enter their name, hit checkboxes for added toppings (Whipped Cream / Chocolate) and increment or decrement the number of coffees to the order. The User can select ORDER and a comprehensive ORDER_SUMMARY will be displayed with the total cost. The App can send the order summary to the User's email app to be sent to an email adress of choice.
